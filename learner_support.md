## WIP Learner Support Policy

### Introduction
This policy aims to provide the coaching staff of Craft Academy with a detailed guide on how we give support to learners attending our courses. 
The overall goal is two folded: we want to provide the **best possible learning experience** for our customers and create a **good work environment** for the team. 

### The Learning Experience
Each week of the camp aims to convey certain skills to our learners. In order to do that, we have attached certain Learning Objectives to each week and designed a set of challenges (one or more) for our learners to work on in order to allow them to gain practical knowledge. 


### Work environment 

Each week of the camp has one **Head Coach** and one or two **Support Coaches**. These staff members are the ones primarily in charge of the delivery. In some cases, the Learning Objectives calls for delivery of talks and lectures that can not be covered by this team, and calls for additional resources (from within the CA team, or external resources). 
These resources are not involved in supporting learners. 

All staff members assigned to a specific week are referred to as **Delivery Team** for that week. Support is divided in **First line** and **Second line** support with resources allocated to each line. 

If possible, a daily split between support and work on internal/external projects is introduced in order to make the work environment as good as possible.
[TALKING POINT]

### Schedule (example) 
#### Week 5
Head Coach: Senior Coach
Support Coach(es): Coach 1, Coach 2
Other resources: Coach 3

Support schedule

- Monday: First line: Coach 1, Second line: Senior Coach
- Tuesday: First line: Coach 2, Second line: Senior Coach
- Wednesday: First line: Coach 1, Second line: Senior Coach
- Thursday: First line: Coach 2, Second line: Senior Coach
- Friday: First line: Coach 1, Coach 2, Second line: Senior coach

The theory is that Friday is rather hectic in terms of delivery and the cohort needs more extensive support.



### Support Protocol

We have a separate document with guidelines for how we give support in order to follow the agile process. 

#### Unblocking flow:
- Check syntax and naming
- Use Pry for debugging
- Make sure that you are in the right folder/project
- Go through the scenario, feature or unit specs again make sure they are correct
- Cross check it with the story, make sure that you are in scope
- Google the error message displayed in the terminal or console
- Ask fellow students in the cohort slack channel
- Read the course documentation if there are any steps missing or overlooked
- Read through official documentation for the gem/framework
- Rephrase the question and google the problem, take special note on StackOverflow (check the date of the answers)
- Post the question/problem on Slack in the cohort channel
- Write a CraftOverflow issue using the template
- Ask a Coach

Try -> Research -> Fellow students -> First line support -> Second line support

**Support will not be given if:**
* Learner did not go through the unblocking flow
* The implementation is developed solo (no Pair Programming)
* There are no tests (unless the learner specifically communicates she/he is working on a Spike) 

**Support flow:**
* Check story on PT or PR description (if there is a PR pending). Are the learners in scope?   
* Go through Acceptance tests - are they in line with the story? 
* Go through Unit tests
* Comment on the tests before moving on 
* Go through the implemented code and leave comments and push the students in the right direction rather than solving the problem.
