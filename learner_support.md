## Learner Support Policy

### Introduction
This policy aim to provide the coaching staff of Craft Academy with a detailed guide on how we give support to lerners attending our courses. 
The overall goal is two folded: we want to provide the **best possible learning experience** for our customers and create a **good work environment** for the team. 

### The Learning Experience
Each week of the camp aims to convey certain skills to our learners. In order to o that, we have attached certain Learning Objectives to each week and designed a set of challenges (one ore more) for our learners to work on in order to allow them to gain practical knowledge. 


### Work environment 

Each week of the camp has one **Head Coach** and one or two **Support Coaches**. These staff members are the ones primerely in charge of the delivery. In some cases, the Learning Objectives calls for delivery of talks and lectures that can not be covered by this team, and calls for additional resources (form within the CA team, or external resources). 
These resources are not involved in supporting learners. 

All staff members assigned to a specific week are reffered to as **Delivery Team** for the specific week. Support is divided in **First line** and **Second line** support with resources allocated to each line. 

If possible, a daily split between support and work on internal/external projects is itroduced in order to make the work environment as good as possible.
[TALKING POINT]

### Schedule (example) 
#### Week 5
Head Coach: Senior Coach
Support Coach(es): Coach 1, Coach 2
Other resources: Coach 3

Support schedule

Monday: First line: Coach 1, Second line: Senior Coach
Tuesday: First line: Coach 2, Second line: Senior Coach
Wednesday: First line: Coach 1, Second line: Senior Coach
Thursday: First line: Coach 2, Second line: Senior Coach
Friday: First line: Coach 1, Coach 2, Second line: Senior coach

The theory is that Friday is rather hecktic in terms of delivery and the cohort need more extensive support.



### Support Protocol

We have a separate document with guidelines for how we give support in order to follow the agile process. 

General guideline are:
Try -> Research -> Fellow students -> First line support -> Second line support

**Do NOT give support if:**
* Learner did not go through the first 3 support sources (Try -> Research -> Fellow students) 
* The implementation is developed solo (no Pair Programming)
* There are no tests (unless the learner specifically communicates she/he is working on a Spike) 

**Support flow:**
* Check story on PT or PR description (if there is a PR pending) Are the learner in scope?   
* Go through Acceptance tests - are they in line with the story? 
* Go through Unit tests
* Comment on the tests before moving on 
* Go through the implemented code and leave comments and push the students in the right direction rather than solving the problem.
