# Week 3 Assessment

You have 30 minutes to complete the assessment. You can look wherever they want for help with your answers (Google, StackOverflow, course materials, etc.), as long as you do not ask me (the coach) for help. To start with, create a folder named `week_2_assessment` (or `week_4_assessment`).


As you work on this exercise, please 'think aloud.' That means verbally describing your mental process as it develops, including the doubts and questions you have, the solution strategies you consider, and the reasons that justify your decisions.‚Äù

### Think Aloud Protocol

The 'Think-aloud' protocol involve the participant thinking aloud as he are performing a set of specified tasks or working on an excercise. The participant are asked to say whatever comes into his mind as he complete the task. This might include what he is looking at, thinking, doing, and feeling. This gives the coach valuable insight into the participant's cognitive processes (rather than only their final product), to make thought processes as explicit as possible during task performance. Sessions should be recorded so that coaches can go back and refer to what participants did and how they reacted.
