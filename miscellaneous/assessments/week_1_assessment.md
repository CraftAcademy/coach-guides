## Week 1 Assessment
Create a folder named `week_1_assessment` and a text file where you can write down your answers.

## Question 1 - Variables
Create a variable and set it equal to 'variable'.  
What are some different data types? Write a few examples.

## Question 2 - Hashes and Arrays
Open irb. We're going to make some cars.
Create two hashes, one for each `car`, with the following attributes: `wheels`, `max_speed`, `color`  
Create an array that contains both cars.  
How do we use the array to access the second car? How do we find the second car's `color`?

## Question 3 - Classes and Methods
Create a new folder called `cars` and inside of that folder, create a file called `car.rb` with:
 - a class Car
 - a method that "paint" a car a new color.
Open irb. Load your 'car.rb' file. Create an instance of a `Car` and change its color.

## Question 4 - Rspec
(Please use your text file to put your answers in)
How do you initialize `rspec` in a folder? Do it in our cars folder.  
We would ordinarily have written our tests first, then written code to make them pass. Why?  
Create a unit test for our `Car` class to test our "painting" method.
Create an `instance_double` `Driver`. A driver should have a car. Write a second test for this and make it pass.
