## Introduction to career coaching events – leaving the nest
The 12 weeks we’ve had together are about to end. What do you feel? Now what can you do with
what you’ve learnt, what happens after the camp? We’ll be talking about this on a daily basis
throughout this week and next. Strategies for how to cope, how to continue to code and learn, how to
present yourself and write a CV, to polish off your projects, with the purpose to internalize what
you’ve been through, and make sense of it all.

Ask the students to watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixLKSdcax5s) of a career talk/campfire chat.

## Preparing for job interviews – KISS, you actually know stuff

you’ve learned and how much you actually know about programming. Presentation of the Joel Test.
Homework: Prepare for tomorrow’s sesson “what makes a professional developer” and read through
the sample questions in the CA github article.
