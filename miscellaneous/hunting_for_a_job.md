### Preparing for an interview
Below is a list of interview questions that you should run through before your upcoming tech interview to get your mind running.

 **This list is by no means exhaustive, and you should be prepared to handle much more complex questions and exercises than these.**

Remember that the best interview questions are open ended and have no definitive answers –  a good interviewer knows this and will be looking for your thought process and problem solving skills, rather than the ‘correct’ answer.

That being said, there are still some straight forward questions that any programmer should be able to answer and discuss.  Many of these questions are relatively simple but being able to explain them in plain english may be more difficult than you think.

Being able to speak to these issues is important, and verbal communication skills are highly indicative of future job performance. However, showing that you can apply and manipulate these concepts is much more difficult than speaking to them in generalities.

To quote Albert Einstein, *‘If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough’*

* [General Personality](self_assessment/general_personality.md)
* [Agile](self_assessment/agile.md)
* [General Ruby questions](self_assessment/general_ruby.md)
* [Advanced Ruby questions](self_assessment/advanced_ruby.md)
* [Databases, ORM's, etc.](self_assessment/databases.md)

**While it’s great to be able to speak to all of these concepts and show that you can carry an in-depth technical conversation, there’s probably nothing more valuable than having a solid portfolio of apps and a demonstrable level of skill.**

## Joel Test

The Joel Test For Programmers (The Simple Programmer Test) A while back, in the year 2000 to be exact, Joel Spolsky (currently CEO of StackOverflow) wrote a blog post entitled: “The Joel Test: 12 Steps to Better Code.” Many software engineers and developers use this test for evaluating a company to determine if a company is a good company to work for.

* Do you use source control?
* Can you make a build in one step?
* Do you make daily builds?
* Do you have a bug database?
* Do you fix bugs before writing new code?
* Do you have an up-to-date schedule?
* Do you have a spec?
* Do programmers have quiet working conditions?
* Do you use the best tools money can buy?
* Do you have testers?
* Do new candidates write code during their interview?
* Do you do hallway usability testing?

A lot of changed since then.

Here is a suggestion of The Joel Test for today:

* Do you fulfill all 12 requirements from The Joel Test?
* Do you have unit tests?
* Do you have integration tests?
* Are you doing Code Reviews?
* Do you have Continuous Integration?
* Do you have Continuous Delivery?
* Can you deploy new version every day?
* Is every area of “project specific expertise” covered by at least 2 people?
* Can you setup developer environment automatically?
* Can every developer run full test suite in less than 1 hour (locally or remotely)?
* Do you have telemetry and logging to reproduce users’ behavior?
* Are you making decisions based on data?
