### Preparing for an interview
Below is a list of interview questions that you should run through before your upcoming tech interview to get your mind running.

 **This list is by no means exhaustive, and you should be prepared to handle much more complex questions and exercises than these.**

Remember that the best interview questions are open ended and have no definitive answers –  a good interviewer knows this and will be looking for your thought process and problem solving skills, rather than the ‘correct’ answer.

That being said, there are still some straight forward questions that any programmer should be able to answer and discuss.  Many of these questions are relatively simple but being able to explain them in plain english may be more difficult than you think.

Being able to speak to these issues is important, and verbal communication skills are highly indicative of future job performance. However, showing that you can apply and manipulate these concepts is much more difficult than speaking to them in generalities.

To quote Albert Einstein, *‘If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough’*

* [General Ruby questions](self_assessment/general_ruby.md)
* [Advanced Ruby questions](self_assessment/advanced_ruby.md)
* [Databases, ORM's, etc.](self_assessment/databases.md)

**While it’s great to be able to speak to all of these concepts and show that you can carry an in-depth technical conversation, there’s probably nothing more valuable than having a solid portfolio of apps and a demonstrable level of skill.**
