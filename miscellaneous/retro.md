### Retrospective
The end of week 2 is a good time to do a retrospective meeting with the cohort. After that the retrospective should be held on a biweekly basis.

The meeting should be facilitated by the Community Manager or one of the coaches. Preferably not the Head Coach or the coach that currently works with the group.

The scope of the meeting is to discuss the just-concluded two week period (sprint) and determines what could be changed that might make the next sprint more productive for the team as a whole and for individual members. Also, it's very important that the students get a chance to vent and feel that we as a organization listen and respond to their needs. **The retrospective is however not only for the students but for benefit of the whole team.** The retrospective is a collaborative process among all team members, including both the students and the coaches as well as the Community Manager and possibly other staff members.

### The model
The model for the discussion is to answer or address 3 key questions:

- What went well during the period?
- What went wrong during the period?
- What could we do differently to improve the learning experience for everybody?

The **objective** is to identify 2 or 3 **action points** that the team will implement and use during the next sprint.

### Key elements of the retrospective:
* Action Points are formulated and agreed upon at the end of the meeting. This ensures that the team is always improving on their performance.
* All stakeholders must be given an opportunity to identify what went well and what could be improved.
The stakeholders discuss the process that they are following and give any suggestions for improvement.
* The stakeholders discuss any other ideas that could enhance their learning experience and/or improve their productivity.
* The facilitator prioritizes actions and lessons learned based on team direction.
* The retrospective supports team formation and bonding, particularly as any areas of conflict can be identified and dealt with.
* The retrospective helps build the team's sense of ownership and its self-management.
