### Retrospective
The end of week 2 is a good time to do a retrospective meeting with the cohort. After that the retrospective should be held on a biweekly basis.

The meeting should be facilitated by the Community Manager or one of the coaches. Preferably not the head coach or the coach that currently works with the group.

The scope of the meeting is to discuss the just-concluded two week period (sprint) and determines what could be changed that might make the next sprint more productive for the team as a whole and for individual members. Also, it's very important that the students get a chance to vent.

- What went well during the period?
- What went wrong during the period?
- What could we do differently to improve the learning experience for everybody?

The **objective** is to identify 2 or 3 action points that the coaches or the team will implement and use during the next sprint.

#### Agenda
- Introduce the purpose of the meeting
- Let each student talk a minute or two about their general thoughts on the sprint.

  - What went well during the period?
  - What went wrong during the period?
  - What could we do differently?

- Summarize what we have decided upon.
