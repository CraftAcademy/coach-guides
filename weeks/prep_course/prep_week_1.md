## Week 1

### The Terminal, Development Environment, & Version Control

This week, we'll learn to use our terminal - a way to give our computer commands directly. 
We'll also set up our developer environment so we can start coding and work with version control for good project management.

### Demos
* Thursday - Version control (Git, GitHub...)
* Friday - File management and terminal commands demo & Developer Environment Setup
### Resources
First hand we want to host our own talks but also share prerecorded sessions with the students. Watch and find inspiration.
