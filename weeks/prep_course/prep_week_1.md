## Week 1 (Chapter 1)

### The Terminal, Development Environment, & Version Control

This week, we'll learn to use our terminal - a way to give our computer commands directly. 
We'll also set up our developer environment so we can start coding and work with version control for good project management.

### Learning objectives

* How to work and get confortable with the Terminal 
* Working with Version control locally and with Github
* Collaboration using Version control
* Practice HTML & CSS

* Thursday - Version control (Git, GitHub & Intro to Git Pong) 4pm
### Resources
First hand we want to host our own talks but also share prerecorded sessions with the students. Watch and find inspiration.
