## Week 4 

### Fundimentals of the Web & Address book challenge 

Web application development refers broadly to the tasks associated with developing applications based on web technologies and accessible over Internet. 
What we ofter refer to as The Internet, is a global computer network providing a variety of information and communication facilities, consisting of hundreds of interconnected networks using standardized communication protocols. 
Web applications are a type of client/server applications where the information is carried over the HTTP protocol over that set of distributed networks.

Web applications are usually build around two parts that are connected to eachother; a user facing client and a data handling server part. These are commonly refered to as front- and back-end applications.
This course aims to close the gap between front- and backend development and bring a deeper understanding of the complete request-response lifecycle.
