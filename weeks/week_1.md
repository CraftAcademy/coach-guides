## Week 1
### Introduction to this week

#### Swedish
**Testdriven utveckling och introduktion till Ruby**

Första veckans utmaning handlar om att bygga en enkel Bankomatsimulator. Låter kanske trivialt men utmaningen ligger i att förstå hur en vardaglig situation kan se ut när man tänker i programmeringstermer och hur olika objekt interagerar med varandra. Under veckan introducerar vi en mängd nya begrepp och koncept som lägger grunden för din fortsatta utveckling. Vi praktiserar par programmering och test driven utveckling. Vi tampas med versionskontroll och rubyspråkets syntax. Vi introducerar även användarfokuserad synsätt för programutveckling. Veckan avslutas med din första individuella Weekend Challenge.

#### English
**Test driven development and introduction to Ruby**
The first week's challenge is to build a simple ATM Simulator. The challenge is about understanding how an everyday situation might look like when you think about it in terms of code and how different objects interact with each other. During the week, we introduce a number of new terms and concepts that lay the foundation for your future development. We practice test driven development and we also struggle with version control and more advanced Ruby syntax. During this week we also introduce a user-focused approach to program development. The week ends with your first individual Weekend Challenge.
