## Week 1
### Introduction to this week

#### Swedish
**Testdriven utveckling och introduktion till Ruby**

Första veckans utmaning handlar om att bygga en enkel Bankomatsimulator. Låter kanske trivialt men utmaningen ligger i att förstå hur en vardaglig situation kan se ut när man tänker i programmeringstermer och hur olika objekt interagerar med varandra. Under veckan introducerar vi en mängd nya begrepp och koncept som lägger grunden för din fortsatta utveckling. Vi praktiserar par programmering och test driven utveckling. Vi tampas med versionskontroll och rubyspråkets syntax. Vi introducerar även användarfokuserad synsätt för programutveckling. Veckan avslutas med din första individuella Weekend Challenge.

#### English
**Test driven development and introduction to Ruby**
The first week's challenge is to build a simple ATM Simulator. The challenge is about understanding how an everyday situation might look like when you think about it in terms of code and how different objects interact with each other. During the week, we introduce a number of new terms and concepts that lay the foundation for your future development. We practice test driven development and we also struggle with version control and more advanced Ruby syntax. During this week we also introduce a user-focused approach to program development. The week ends with your first individual Weekend Challenge.

* Learn about
  - Speed-overview of prep course to repeat key concepts
  - classes and attributes
  - writing tests using RSpec
  - using `double`, `class_double` and `instance_double`
  - the benefits of writing automated tests
  - debugging
  - Understand the three data layers and how to use a simple "database": a YAML file

### Support guide: EVERY SUPPORT REQUEST NEEDS TO BE SUBMITTED TO CraftOverflow
- Issue on https://github.com/CraftAcademy/CraftOverflow/issues
  - read/search through old issues (closed) BEFORE posting a question
  - post a question according to the template 
  - a Slack notification will be posted and a coach will respond.

### Day One Things
- Notebooks and pens for all participants (I'd like to do a really nice thing with printed pages but for now, just a notebook with a sticker on it is good.)
- Buy lunch for them Pizzas
- Introduce the entire team. If you don't want to be available at all hours of the day, give them hours of your availability.
- As much as possible, have logistics already set up: cohort and Atlantis rooms clean and ready to work in, monitors and cables ready, headphones, brickor for the students. (Noel has booked The Room - Stockholm)
