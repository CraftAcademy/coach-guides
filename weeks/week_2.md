**Mera JavaScript**

Vi forsätter med att introducera ytterligare ett programmeringsspråk med tillhörande testverktyg - JavaScript och Jasmine. Samtidigt går vi igenom grunderna i HTML och CSS och bygger en applikation som räknar ut din Body Mass Index (BMI challenge) och publicerar vår första app på internet.

We'll also continue our journey into Test Driven Development and introduce more advanced testing strategies  
We introduce another programming language and associated testing framework - JavaScript and Jasmine.
