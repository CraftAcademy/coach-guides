## Week 3
### Introduction to this week

#### Swedish
**Parprogrammering och Användarorienterad utveckling**
Vi inleder denna vecka med att lägga grunden för ett onlinesystem som låter användarna beställa mat online (SlowFood Challenge). Vi introducerar ett ramverk för webbaserade applikationer ([Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/)) och ger deltagarna en första inblick i hur man jobbar med agila utvecklingsmetoder med fokus på Behavior Driven Development. SlowFood Challenge handlar även om designmönstret Model-View-Controller, relationsdatabaser och funktioner för användarregistrering, autentisering och auktorisering. Vid veckans slut är vi redo att gå live med SlowFood Online och vi publicerar vårt system med hjälp av Heroku. För att underlätta och automatisera vår deploy-process använder tekniker som Continuous Integration och Continuous Deployment.

**Pair Programming and User-Oriented Development**
In week 3 we lay the foundation for an online system that allows users to order food online (Slow Food Challenge). We introduce a framework for web based applications ([Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/)) and give participants an insight into how to work with agile development with a focus on Behavior Driven Development. Slow Food Challenge is also about the design pattern Model-View-Controller, relational and features for user registration, authentication, and authorization. At the end of the week, we are ready to go live with the Slow Food Online and we publish our system using Heroku. To facilitate and automate deployment, our process uses techniques like Continuous Integration and Deployment.

* Learn about the basics of working with Legacy code
* Learn about User Authentication
* Learn about the hardships that will occur if we can't read documentation for libraries we use in our projects (gems).
* Basics of Test- and Behavior Driven Development or Acceptance - Unit Test cycle (Do we want to introduce this change at the moment?)
* Really embrace and understand the benefits of Pair Programming && collaboration using Git and GitHub
* understand Rack based applications
* learn about deployment to Heroku and the benefits of services like Heroku, DigitalOcean and AWS

### Weekend challenge
SlowFood (Sinatra) (User Interface/UX) - Note: group challenge
The weekend is devoted to focus on the User experience of the app. Here we start looking at the styling. We want them to notice that the planning they did in the initial stage was not detailed enough and that they missed he focus on the user.
### Learning objectives
* All of the above
* Also learn about:
  - the importance of focusing on what the end-user sees on the site.
  - the true benefit of working with Lo-Fi's as a way to foresee what the user will experience when using the app and how much that helps in our development process.
* Front-end technologies
  - CSS frameworks
  - jQuery
  - CDN's ??
