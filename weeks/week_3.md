## Week 3 Rails Week
### Introduction to this week

#### Swedish
**Software as a Service med Ruby on Rails**

Den här veckan dyker vi djupare in i Ruby on Rails - ett ramverk som hjälper programmeraren att följa designmönstret Model-View-Controller (MVC) och lär dem att jobba efter grundprinciperna Convention Over Configuration (Konvention före konfiguration) och Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) som går ut på att motverka duplicering av kod. Vi introducerar också mer omfattande teststrategier och befäster deltagarnas kunskaper för hur de använder tester i sin utvecklingsprocess. Vi forsätter med att fördjupa oss i Rails och går igenom mer avancerade tekniker för hur man använder externa bibliotek (gems), API'er, websockets, mm.


#### English
**Software as a Service with Ruby on Rails**

Software as a Service - Work the web! This week we introduce Ruby on Rails and introduce strategies to work effectively with legacy code. We present more complex testing strategies and help you understand how testing can greatly improve your workflow. This week we deepen our knowledge of external libraries (gems), APIs, websockets, etc.

### Teachable Course
[Testing in Ruby on Rails](https://learn.craftacademy.co/admin/courses/659667/information)

### Week Lab
The students are introduced to Ruby on Rails this week. We are exposing them to the 'magic' of Rails AND to the best practice of using various testing frameworks to drive their development.

The Legacy Code Challenge aims at allowing students to write both acceptance tests and unit tests for a ready made application
1. Acceptance-Unit Test Cycle with Rails (individual assignment)
2. Legacy Code challenge (pairing assignment)

Get the cohort to create a Rails application that can be used throughout the rest of the bootcamp
