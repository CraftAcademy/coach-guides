### Week lab
The students are introduced to Ruby on Rails this week. We are exposing them to the 'magic' of Rails AND how to build and maintain an API.

The Legacy Code Challenge aims at allowing students to write both acceptance tests and unit tests for a ready made api.
1. AUT cycle as intro to Rails (individual assigment)
2. Legacy code challenge (pairing assignment)

### Learning objectives
* How to build API only Rails applications
* How to test API endpoints using request specs
* Test React SPA


### Weekend Challenge
* Adding devise token auth to the rails intro api and restrict the edit and create action to only authenticated users. 

### Head Coach: Emma
