## Week 6
### Introduction to this week

#### Swedish
**Mid Course Project**

Halvvägs genom kursen är det dags att omsätta dina kunskaper i praktik och släppa taget om coachens trygga vägledning. Det är dags för dig att tänka ut, planera för, och bygga ditt eget projekt. Syftet är självklart att konsolidera dina kunskaper och börja bygga upp en egen projektportfölj. Du jobbar i team och bestämma själva vilken kod ni ska skriva och vilka funktioner som ska utvecklas, men även fatta beslut om vilka planeringsverktyg ni vill använda och när och hur man delegerar och fördelar arbetet. Det är teamet håller i spakarna - coacherna håller ett vakande öga för att se till att alla gör framsteg och hjälper till när det behövs. Det är en stor vecka här på Craft Academy.

#### English
**Mid Course Project**

Halfway through the course, it is time for you to test your knowledge and take a step away from coach-led exercises. It is time for you to dream up, plan for, and build your own project. Working in teams or groups, you will not only decide what code to write and which features to implement, but also which planning tools to utilize and when and how to delegate assignments, while we keep a watchful eye to make sure everyone is making progress. It's a big week here at Craft Academy.
