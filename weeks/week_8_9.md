# Week 8 - 9 News Room
### Introduction to this week

#### Swedish
**Avancerad Rails, API'er och Agila utvecklingsmetoder**

Allt handlar om att plocka på sig erfarenhet och kompetens (som vi definierar kunskap omsatt i praktik). Under tre veckor bygger vi en avancerad marketplace-applikation som en fortsättning på vår News Room utmaning. Vi fördjupar oss i konceptet med API'r som hjälper oss att öppna upp vårt system för andra utvecklare, jobbar med mer avancerade planeringsverktyg, följer de agila arbetsmetoderna och sjösäter en fullvärdig lösning.

#### English
**Advanced Rails, APIs and Agile development methods**

These weeks strengthen and deepen your competence and experience with a large project that tests the knowledge you have gained thus far. During these three weeks, you'll build a complex and detailed application, based on the prototype you develop in Week Three. This time, you will add multiple layers of complexity, and work in Rails as News Room becomes a marketplace with several user types. We will practice Agile workflow, pushing you to work efficiently. At the end of these weeks, you will have a large, complicated, and impressive project to add to your portfolio.
