# Week 8 - 9 News Room
### Introduction to this week

#### Swedish
**Avancerad Rails, API'er och Agila utvecklingsmetoder**

Allt handlar om att plocka på sig erfarenhet och kompetens (som vi definierar kunskap omsatt i praktik). Under tre veckor bygger vi en avancerad marketplace-applikation som en fortsättning på vår News Room utmaning. Vi fördjupar oss i konceptet med API'r som hjälper oss att öppna upp vårt system för andra utvecklare, jobbar med mer avancerade planeringsverktyg, följer de agila arbetsmetoderna och sjösäter en fullvärdig lösning.

#### English
**Advanced Rails, APIs and Agile development methods**

Welcome to the News Room Challenge. These weeks strengthen and deepen your competence and experience with a large project that tests the knowledge you have gained thus far. During these three weeks, you'll build a complex and detailed application. This time, you will add multiple layers of complexity, and work in Rails as News Room becomes a fully featured news and editorial platform with several user types and roles. We will practice Agile workflow, pushing you to work efficiently. At the end of these weeks, you will have a large, complex, and impressive project to add to your portfolio.
